# DC-News Portfolio Site

This is the front-end visualisation using React and Material UI to host my back-end api from heroku. My objective was to make the website an enjoyable and good looking experience for any account user or passerby.

## Getting Started
This will be a step-by-step guide to getting a copy of this website onto your local machine to run from. Having said that, I also have a deployed version which you can access [on this site](https://dc-news-portfolio.netlify.com/).

### Prerequisites
When you end up with the project on your local machine through the following steps, you will run a command to install a number of things required for the site to work. They will be installed locally where the project is stored, therefore when you decide to delete the local copy, you will also delete the packages you've downloaded and installed to run the project.

### Installing
To get a local copy and run it as intended, you will need to first open up your terminal/command line. Then, copy and paste the following lines of code into the terminal, entering each time a new line is pasted and waiting for the process to finish.

`git clone https://github.com/smegbot1/NC-News-Portfolio`

`cd /NC-News-Portfolio`

`npm install`

`npm start`

> NOTE: It is usually a good idea to have your desired browser already open before the last command. Should you run into any problems with 'npm start', try opening your browser first and then running the command.

Following those commands should land you on the homepage of my project, running locally on your machine. Enjoy!

## Built With
- React - The front end library/framework used for this project
- Material UI - The styling library I used for the components
- axios - The HTTP client I used to make requests to my hosted api
